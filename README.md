An android application to help you find and share recipes.<br>
This application was developed as our project for CS 442 @ UIC in Spring '24.
<br>
## The Idea:<br>
The idea for this application is to create a platform for users to find and share recipes as a community. The app offers users the ability to search for community recipes based on the ingredients that they have. It also allows users to search for recipes on the web based on keywords.

## Installing the app:

1. Download smartgrocery_release3.apk
2. Tap on the file in your phone's file browser to initiate installation.
3. Your phone may ask you to allow installation from unknown sources - accept if it does ask.

## The Functionalities:
### 1. Add a recipe: 
Allows users to add a recipe to share with the community.<br>
### 2. Explore: 
Search for recipes from the web.<br>
### 3. Home: 
Shows the user a colelction of featured recipes in a carousel, and a list of community recipes that they can scroll through and filter based on keywords.<br>
### 4. Recommendations: 
Users enter the ingredients they have in their kitchen, and the app recommends community recipes based on if the ingredients are an exact match or a partial match.<br>
### 5. Profile: 
Users can favorite recipes, add ingredients to their shopping list based on the recipes that they see, find grocery stores near them and see the recipes that they've added to the community.<br>
